# The legacy of (old) code

## Memory of first steps

When you started out coding, you heard that solving coding katas
can improve your skills.

So you searched the interwebs and found one
[here](http://codingdojo.org/kata/Bowling/).

It instructed to write tests so you did.
Write a test, make it pass, go on to the next one.
No time to refactor when the goal is on the horizon.

At the end you've added some tests for good measure and called it a day.

## Stirring up the past

Now that you have solved many more katas (many times)
and you know about refactoring and clean code principles
you decided instead to revisit an old solution of yours
and see if you can improve on it.

## What are you supposed to do?

Clone the repo from [here](https://github.com/whatever).
Make sure you can run the tests and they pass.
```
python tests.py -v
```
(Use version 3 of python)

Then refactor your code according to the clean code principles.

## Rules you decided to follow

* Always keep the existing tests passing
* Don't delete any tests
* Commit early commit often
* Only refactor code that is covered by tests
